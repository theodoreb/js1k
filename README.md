My entry for the js1k contest
===========================

original idea by : [One-LED clock](http://www.opengpstracker.org/one-led-clock.html)

> This project is a silent clock that requires no visual acuity (focusing ability) to read. Like many techies, I am fairly nearsighted. I can wear contact lenses and see okay, but if I wake up at night and want to know what time it is, I have to get within a few inches of the clock to read it. This is a common problem for people with vision problems, and there should be a technical solution.

I totally agree.


How does it work ?
-----------------

red are hours and increment by one, green are minutes and increment by 5.

RED-RED-RED-GREEN-GREEN would be between 3h10 and 3h15.

There is nothing to distinguish from am/pm, trust yourself.
